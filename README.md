# 1. Introduction

I want to manage React state efficiently, so I will compare managers and summarize sample code. \
There are several criteria for selecting a manager.

- Typescript support
- Continuously updated
- Easy to read official documentation

It is very important that the official documentation is easy to read. \
Easy-to-read documentation greatly increases development efficiency.
